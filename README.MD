# Web Programming Lecture Website

## Overview
This project is a static website to provide lecture materials for a 15-week Web Programming course targeting first-year university students in Gyeonggi-do, South Korea. The website is built entirely using GitHub Copilot for code generation, debugging, and optimization. It features a main page with a curriculum overview and individual pages for each week's materials, linked via a responsive navigation menu.

### Course Details
- **Target Audience**: First-year university students with basic programming knowledge (includes review).
- **Course Goal**: Enable students to create static and dynamic web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, culminating in a project-based learning experience.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Attendance: 20% (weekly participation and in-class exercises).
  - Midterm: 20% (project proposal document + HTML/CSS prototype, submitted in Week 8).
  - Final: 60% (complete web project submission and presentation, starting from Week 13).
- **Tools**: Web browser, VS Code (with GitHub Copilot extension), GitHub for version control.
- **Copilot Usage**: Code autocompletion, inline chat for CSS/JS, debugging suggestions, and comment generation.

### Website Structure
- `index.html`: Main page with course overview and curriculum table linking to weekly pages.
- `styles.css`: Responsive CSS with Flexbox, media queries, and animations.
- `script.js`: JavaScript for navigation toggle and dynamic content loading.
- `week1.html` to `week15.html`: Individual pages for each week's materials.
- `images/`: Folder for diagrams, screenshots, or placeholder images.
